# React coding challenge 2019.

1) Ensure NPM is installed on your computer
2) Fork this repo. 
3) Clone the forked repo to your computer.
4) In the repo, (i.e. react-example folder), run `npm install`
5) Once `npm install` completes, run `npm run start`.
6) The URL http://localhost:3000/ should open in your browser,
   otherwise navigate to http://localhost:3000/
7) You should now see the React page in your browser.
   
### In the `src` folder there are 3 JS files, `Clock.js`, `ColorBox.js`, and `Contacts.js`.

## 1) For `Clock.js`:
Complete componentDidMount() so that the clock updates every second.

## 2) For `Colorbox.js`:
Given the constructor, complete First() and Second() methods to update ColorBox h1 background color when 'First' and 'Second' buttons are clicked.

## 3) For `Contacts.js`:
Assuming the API url is http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users complete componentDidMount() to display the contacts list.

### Your changes should appear live in the browser once you save the files.
 
## 4) Responsively style the index.html page and JSX templates using bootstrap classes.
Bootstrap css is already included in the app. Use bootstrap classes and the proper
html tags to style the page so that each component is in a proper section and has adequate spacing and margins.

## Total effort for this project should not exceed 60 mins; feel free to make assumptions but please note when doing so.
